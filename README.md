# Pacmen-Exercise
# Description: This program is an animation. When the program is ran,it creates a new pacman character every time the 'Add Pacman' button is clicked. 
# How To Run: After opening the program, click the add pacmen button on the top left to add the desired amount of pacmen. Click the start game to increase the speed of movement of pacmen.
# Future Improvements: My plan is to work on fixing the issue where when a pacman is created and covers the 'start game' button, the button is still clickable.
